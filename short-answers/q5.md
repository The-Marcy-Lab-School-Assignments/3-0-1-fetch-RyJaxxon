# Question

What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer

The two arguments that we input with fetch are a `url` and `object` (optional). The URL is essentially the resource we're using, while the object is where we apply any custom settings we'd want. Such as the method, headers, or body.

The `fetch` function returns a promise that resolves to a response object. It represents the response to the request.
