# Question

`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - a true or false response that shows whether or not the response was successful.

2. `Response.status` - provides a status code that can give you information on the status of the response, like a 404 error.

3. `Response.url` - shows the final URL of the response.

4. `Response.headers` - shows additional information about the request/response, such as the media type, content length, or host.
