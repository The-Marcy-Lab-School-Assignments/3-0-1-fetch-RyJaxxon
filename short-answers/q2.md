# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer
The HTTP Request/ Response cycle refers to how our computers communicate and receive data. One side (the client) sends a **request** for information to the other (the server), after which the the server **responds**, sending back information based on the request which the client then processes and renders to the page. This could be anything from loading an image to filling a form with previous information!
